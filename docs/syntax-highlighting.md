# Syntax Highlighting

## VSCode Integration

Syfar has a VSCode extension that provides syntax highlighting and language support for `.sf` files. 

You can install the VSCode extension by downloading the `.vsix` file from [here](https://github.com/dinyad-prog00/syfar/highlighting/vscode/syfar-0.0.2.vsix), and then installing it manually in VSCode:

1. Open VSCode.
2. Go to the Extensions view.
3. Click on the ellipsis (`...`) in the top-right corner and select **Install from VSIX**.
4. Choose the downloaded `syfar-0.0.2.vsix` file.

This extension integrates seamlessly with the Syfar Language Server, providing real-time validation, autocompletion, and error diagnostics.



## Syfar Language Server

The **Syfar Language Server** provides key features such as autocompletion, real-time validation, and error diagnostics, making it easier to work with Syfar test files. It is currently used in the Syfar VSCode extension and will eventually support other IDEs. 

For more details, visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dinyad-prog00/syfar-ls) [WIP].

The Syfar Language Server is designed to enhance your development experience by integrating seamlessly with editors like VSCode and will be used to support other popular IDEs.
